# World Population EDA Project
This project provides an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **World Population** dataset using Python. The dataset includes global population data segmented by country, year, region, and other demographic factors. The aim is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform understanding of population growth, distribution, and changes over time.

## Objectives

- Understand global and regional population trends
- Identify top and bottom countries by population
- Analyze year-over-year growth
- Explore correlations with population density, urbanization, and area
- Visualize population data in intuitive and engaging ways

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes variables such as:
- `Country`
- `Capital`
- `Continent`
- `Year`
- `Population`
- `Area (km²)`
- `Density (per km²)`
- `Growth Rate`
- `World Population &`
